CricketScorer
=============
CricketScorer is a simple [web app](http://mniebling.github.io/CricketScorer/) that I hacked together to help us score dart games when our office's electronic dartboard stopped working.

It's optimized to run on an iPad but works okay in other browsers too. 

Tap the plus button for each mark you hit (tap repeatedly for doubles or triples), then tap "Done" when your flight is finished. 

If you make a mistake, tap "Remove Darts" at the top to back a dart out. Don't go too crazy with this as I'm sure there's edge cases I haven't covered with that functionality. :)
